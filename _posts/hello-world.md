So I have finally decided to publish my own blog and this is the first entry on it, my hello world!. My main motivation is to document, for my future self and to others, the methodologies and processes I used in my day to day work.

The idea is to have a repository of knowledge to which I can resort back any time I want to remember how I did something, let's face it, this happens more than we want to admit.

This is the nth iteration in trying to build this thing. This time I have decided to use `tightenco/jigsaw` to get started easy and faster, which is a great package to build static sites.
