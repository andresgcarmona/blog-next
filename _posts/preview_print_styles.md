When working with print styles It gets really annoying to bring the print dialog every time you want to preview your changes. Google Chrome makes it easy to us to view and edit the print styles right in the browser.

Just press `ctrl+shift+p` to bring the command dialog and type `render`, you'l see something like the following picture:

Select `Show rendering` to show the `Rendering tab` and in the `Emulate CSS media type` select `PRINT`
